# cs362-catch-tests
Some test files I wrote as a grader for a data structures course. Tests use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) C++ framework.

Selected files include tests for a custom templated binary search tree class as well as a list class.

Binary search tree class tests also include auto-grading with explicit indications on failures.
